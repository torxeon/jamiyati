### **Design Style Guide: Islamic Center Society**

**Objective:** To establish a unified and scalable design system that reflects the Society's core values of trust, community service, and professionalism. The design should be clean, accessible, and rooted in its established Islamic identity.

#### **1\. Core Identity & Branding**

* **Logo:** The primary logo is the calligraphic name "جمعية المركز الإسلامي الخيرية"11. It is often enclosed within a circular or hexagonal shape, sometimes featuring Islamic geometric patterns.

  * **Usage:**  
    * Always maintain the logo's original aspect ratio. Do not stretch or distort it.  
    * Ensure a minimum clear space around the logo equal to 25% of its width.  
    * Use the full-color version on light backgrounds (white or beige)2222. A monochrome white version can be used on dark backgrounds like the brand's primary red3333.

* **Organizational Identity:** The design should consistently communicate the Society's focus on three main pillars:  
  * Social Welfare (الرعاية الإجتماعية) 444
